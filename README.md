# Hospital-optimization
This project optimizes hospital locations on a 2D grid to minimize Manhattan distances to houses. Visualizations include heat maps and 3D cost landscapes.

## Features  
- Visualizes 2D and 3D Manhattan distance heat maps.
- Ladder-like paths show hospital movements across optimization steps.
- Customizable grid size, house/hospital count.
